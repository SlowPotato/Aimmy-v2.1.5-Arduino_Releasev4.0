Check your HOST SHIELD Board for pre-soldering, if no solder is in the areas shown below then you will need to buy a soldering iron and solder to bridge the connections.

Do the following below if you have a "non" pre-soldered board.

If using a HOST SHIELD select "Y" when prompted if you don't have one just select "N". HOST SHIELD is "recommended" for games on STEAM, EA, Battlenet etc... since the newest patch 10/15/25 blocks 2nd mouse inputs such as Leonardo R3 alone without a HOST SHIELD, DDxoft, Mouse Events, Razer Drivers, LG Hub Drivers. [If using without HOST SHIELD this will still work on other games that block out most external mouse inputs]
